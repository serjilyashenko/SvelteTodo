# Svelte Todo List

The repository is a source code base for Medium article `Svelte Quick Start`.
The article is about `Svelte - The magical disappearing UI framework`.

The goal of the article is to introduce Svelte syntax fast by creating Todo app step by step.
Todo App uses all operations of the CRUD principle: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
It makes a Todo App good candidate for Svelte framework introduction.
